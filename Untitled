Turn off mic, put on lapel, turn on, speak naturally (blah blah blah)

Outline
1. App is called insider
2. Goal is to drag craigslist kicking and screaming into the 21st century

A bit about me:
  * My path to software development took some rather odd * turns.
  * In college I studied classics (which is the study of the ancient world), focusing on Ancient Greek and Latin
  * In 2014 I completed my dissertation and received my PhD in classics from Cornell.
  * I decided I didn't want to spend the rest of my life by myself in an office, and decided to explore my lifelong interest in computers and technology.

2. Probably the best way to show you Insider is just to take you through what it can do:
  1. User logs in
  2. User
3. Tech stack includes Postgres, Node, React and Webpack.
  3a. In place of using an API, because craigslist doesn't have one, I made a web scraper, which I tried to use responsibly
4. What Insider can do:
  Gently scrape craigslist
  Store parsed listings for sublets
  Sanitize and display them
  Allow users to filter the listings
  Reorder listings according to user preferences
  Display favorited listings side-by-side
  Map listings with clickable markers
